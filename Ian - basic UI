Howdy y'all, so I "made" (copied from Grav) a basic UI for the game. It's just a menu scene that has buttons that will lead to the other 
scenes. It also has a mute button that will turn the app's sound on and off. Also, if you don't like the image I have for the buttons, 
feel free to change it. It just has to be the same dimensions as the image already in place and it should be somewhere high on the gray 
scale so it can be colored. Remember the @2x and @3x files.

I also set up the app icon but I don't know how to get the launch screen image to work (I've always taken the easy route and set it to
plain black)

As for running the app, I have a developer acount so I can run it on my phone for testing but you guys should be able to download the
project and run it on the simulator. If you can't, try going to the project file and changing the "Team" field to None. I think there's
a way that you guys can run the app on your phones without buying a developer account. It may actually be as easy as just pressing the 
run button with your phone as the target device... I forget. Worst case scenario, I can register your phones on my account and I can
bring my laptop in and put the app on your phones that way.
